This project contains the final code of a micromouse (maze solving robot)
using the NXP LPC1768 microcontroller (based on an Arm Cortex-M3).

The micromouse is an integrated system comprising of a range of components
including sensors for input, a microcontroller board for processing and motors,
LEDs and a LCD for output.
